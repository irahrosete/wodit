## ℹ About

In June 2021, I participated in the Push Up Challenge and did 3,318 push ups in 25 days. The habit stuck with me and three months on, I am still doing daily push ups.

This app is inspired by the [Push Up Challenge](https://www.thepushupchallenge.com.au/). It allows the user to log in the number of push ups they've done for the day. More than anything, it is a habit builder and tracker. If you see it and keep a record of it, it is more likely that you stick to it!

I have added a few more features that I think is beneficial for anyone wanting to have a structured workout to follow at home, outdoors or in the gym (once we're out of this lockdown in Sydney).

## 🔑 Features

- **Push Ups Tracker**. Save, add, remove and track the number of push ups you made each day.
- **WOD (Workout of the Day)**. Follow a structured workout each day. Add your own or keep the one recommended by me.
- **'The Girls'**. Check and test yourself against these benchmark CrossFit workouts.
- **User Authentication**. Sign up, Log in, Sign out to use the application.
- **Admin Dashboard**.

## 🧍‍♂️ Target Audience

This app is for anyone who wishes to form a new habit, follow a workout, and keep track of their push up numbers.
